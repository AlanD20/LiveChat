# Live Chat
A simple chat room that allows users to communicate with each other.
Feel free to try out my project. I would appreciate feedbacks.

## Features:
* Authentication process such as `sign in`, `signup`, `resetting password`.
* Having different roles such as `admin role`, `user role`, `guest role`.
* `Admins` have priviliges to delete messages or clearing the entire chat.
* `Users` can manage their account by changing their name, password, email address as well as deleting account if they wish to delete their account.
* `Guests` are allowed to communicate only in `guest channel` without the ability to change their name or manage their account.
* Hosted on firebase hosting.
